# Day-5 :

Disclaimer: while the concepts underlying these exercises are general, the
            specific outputs and results will be unavoidably linked to the
            HPC system used to perform them.
            As a reference, here you will find the outcomes obtained on the 
            hardware provided by Institut "Jo≈æef Stefan".


### Morning

- Introduction to HPC environment
- Optimized QE configuration and compilation
- Run-time options: description and usage

### Afternoon

- Concise introduction to accelerated hardware details
- Optimized QE-GPU: configuration and compilation
- Run-time options for QE-GPU
- Advanced topics: CUDA-aware MPI, GPU oversubscription.
