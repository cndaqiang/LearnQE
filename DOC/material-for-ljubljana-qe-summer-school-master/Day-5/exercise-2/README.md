# Exercise 2

We will now compile an optimized version of QE.

Let's first see what happens when you forget to prepare the environment correctly.
Clean up everything you did till now with the command

    # Run me!
    module purge

Now download the last QE release and run the `configure` command. 
Copy and paste the following instructions on your terminal:

    # Run me!
    wget https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/archive/qe-6.4.1/q-e-qe-6.4.1.tar.bz2
    tar xjf q-e-qe-6.4.1.tar.bz2
    cd q-e-qe-6.4.1
    ./configure




The final message should look like this:

     1	setting DFLAGS... -D__FFTW
     2	setting IFLAGS... -I$(TOPDIR)/include -I$(TOPDIR)/FoX/finclude -I$(TOPDIR)/S3DE/iotk/include/
     3	configure: creating ./config.status
     4	config.status: creating install/make_lapack.inc
     5	config.status: creating include/configure.h
     6	config.status: creating make.inc
     7	config.status: creating configure.msg
     8	config.status: creating install/make_wannier90.inc
     9	config.status: creating include/c_defs.h
    10	--------------------------------------------------------------------
    11	ESPRESSO can take advantage of several optimized numerical libraries
    12	(essl, fftw, mkl...).  This configure script attempts to find them,
    13	but may fail if they have been installed in non-standard locations.
    14	If a required library is not found, the local copy will be compiled.
       
    15	The following libraries have been found:
    16	  BLAS_LIBS=
    17	  LAPACK_LIBS=$(TOPDIR)/LAPACK/liblapack.a $(TOPDIR)/LAPACK/libblas.a
    18	  FFT_LIBS=
    19	  
    20	  
    21	Please check if this is what you expect.

(lines 16 and 17 may differ depending on particular set of libraries 
installed as part of the operating system)

The current configuration will probably allow you to compile QE without problems, 
but this version will give you wired results when running on a multicore cluster.

Now let's go back and reload all modules.

    # Run me!
    module load mpi/openmpi-x86_64 MKL/mkl_2019.4.243

This time we configure the optimal executable straight away with the following configuration string:

    # Run me!
    ./configure --enable-openmp --with-scalapack=yes

Let's review what these options are:

1. `--enable-openmp` will enable the low lying parallel layer based on OpenMP directives.
2. `--with-scalapack=yes` will enable the interface for distributed linear algebra and especially the parallel eigenvalue solver. NB: when using Intel's compilers, this should instead be set to `--with-scalapack=yes`.

After configure script completes inspect the final log.

In order to squeeze as much performance as possible, the final 
suggestion is to exploit the ELPA library (https://elpa.mpcdf.mpg.de/software).

You can do this with the following configuration command:


    # Run me!
    module load mpi/openmpi-x86_64 MKL/mkl_2019.4.243
    cd q-e-qe-6.4.1
    export ELPAROOT=/net/hold/data1/arc/software/QEshare/elpa/hsw-omp/
    ./configure --enable-openmp --with-scalapack=yes \
     --with-elpa-include="${ELPAROOT}/include/elpa_openmp-2017.11.001/modules/" \
     --with-elpa-lib=${ELPAROOT}/lib/libelpa_openmp.a

where the ELPA library has already been compiled for you and installed
under `ELPAROOT`.

Finally, compile everything with:

    # Run me!
    make -j pw

and check that the `pw.x` executable is present in the `bin` directory.

## Answers to questions

---

<a name="A1"></a> **Answer 1**: this log actually tells us **many** things:

*  as mentioned in the last line, you should really check this log! üòâ
* Line 1: there are at least three problems here.
    1. The flag `-D__MPI'` is missing, meaning that a serial executable will be compiled.
    2. The flag `-D__FFTW'` means that the internal (old) copy of the  FFTW library will be used. This is generally far from optimal.
    3. The internal version of BLAS and LAPACK will be used. This is in general, on a HPC machine, not your best option.

<a name="A2"></a> **Answer 2**:

You should have this output:

     1	setting DFLAGS... -D__DFTI -D__MPI -D__SCALAPACK
     2	setting IFLAGS... -I$(TOPDIR)/include -I$(TOPDIR)/FoX/finclude -I$(TOPDIR)/S3DE/iotk/include/ -I/cineca/prod/opt/compilers/intel/pe-xe-2018/binary/mkl/include
     3	configure: creating ./config.status
     4	config.status: creating install/make_lapack.inc
     5	config.status: creating include/configure.h
     6	config.status: creating make.inc
     7	config.status: creating configure.msg
     8	config.status: creating install/make_wannier90.inc
     9	config.status: creating include/c_defs.h

    11	ESPRESSO can take advantage of several optimized numerical libraries
    12	(essl, fftw, mkl...).  This configure script attempts to find them,
    13	but may fail if they have been installed in non-standard locations.
    14	If a required library is not found, the local copy will be compiled.
       
    15	The following libraries have been found:
    16	  BLAS_LIBS=  -lmkl_intel_lp64  -lmkl_intel_thread -lmkl_core
    17	  LAPACK_LIBS=
    18	  SCALAPACK_LIBS=-lmkl_scalapack_lp64 -lmkl_blacs_intelmpi_lp64
    19	  FFT_LIBS=
    20	  
    21	  
    22	Please check if this is what you expect.

1. A parallel executable will be compiled (this is confirmed by the `__MPI` flag)
2. Intel's FFT driver will be used (this is confirmed by the `__DFTI` flag)
3. Parallel distributed linear is enabled ( `-D__SCALAPACK` and the value of `SCALAPACK_LIBS`)
